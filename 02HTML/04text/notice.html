        <h1>Important notice</h1>
        <p>On Sunday January 9th 2010, a gang of goths were spotted stealing several garden gnomes from a shopping center in downtown Milwaukee.
            They were all wearing green jumpsuits and silly hats, and seemed to be having a whale of a time. If anyone has <b>any information</b> about this incident, please contact the police now.</p>
